# Project Post-Mortem: Load Board Automation System

## Project Overview

The Load Board Automation System was designed to automate the extraction of data from multiple freight load boards, analyze this data using AI, and store insights for route optimization. The implementation featured two microservices, PostgreSQL database, and Prometheus monitoring.

## Challenges Faced

### Technical Challenges

1. **Browser Automation in Containers**: Running Puppeteer in a containerized environment presented significant challenges. Alpine Linux required specific dependencies to execute Chrome headless properly. The solution involved custom Dockerfile configurations with explicit Chrome dependency installation and environment variable configurations.

2. **Network Configuration**: Initial implementation faced Docker network resolution issues, particularly with Prometheus monitoring. Services could communicate, but Prometheus couldn't scrape metrics endpoints due to hostname resolution failures.

3. **OpenAI Integration**: Structuring prompts to generate consistent, structured JSON responses from GPT Compute Preview required multiple iterations. Balancing token usage with quality of analysis was a constant consideration.

4. **Data Schema Evolution**: Early in development, we discovered the need for more flexible schema to accommodate different load board data formats, leading to multiple schema migrations.

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Microservice Separation**: We deliberately separated automation from AI analysis to allow independent scaling and deployment. This proved beneficial when load board access patterns required more resources than AI processing.

2. **Data Flow Design**: We implemented a centralized PostgreSQL database instead of service-specific datastores. This simplified reporting but created inter-service dependencies.

3. **Monitoring Strategy**: Every critical operation is instrumented with Prometheus metrics, providing visibility into scraping success rates, AI processing times, and data throughput.

## Key Learnings

1. Container networking requires explicit configuration in multi-service architectures
2. AI model interactions need extensive error handling and retry logic
3. Materialized views significantly improved reporting performance
4. Web scraping automation requires robust error handling with exponential backoff

## Next Steps

1. **Expand Data Sources**: Add support for more load boards to increase market coverage
2. **Enhanced AI Analysis**: Train specialized models on historical load data for more accurate pricing predictions
3. **Real-time Dashboard**: Develop a frontend interface for visualizing trends and insights
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Implement circuit breakers and graceful degradation patterns

## Conclusion

The Load Board Automation System successfully meets its core requirements, providing automated data extraction and AI-powered analysis. While we encountered several technical challenges, particularly with containerization and network configuration, the architecture proved robust and scalable. The separation of concerns between services allows for future enhancement of individual components without system-wide refactoring.
